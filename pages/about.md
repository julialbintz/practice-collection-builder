## About the Collection

Pearl V. Turner was a mountaineer in the early 20th century. Pearl Turner, an alumna from the University of Colorado Boulder Class of 1904, lived and climbed in Colorado, as well as across the United States. The Pearl V. Turner Collection at the University of Colorado Boulder houses original items from Pearl Turner, such as two photo albums about her mountaineering trips, and her collection of mountaineering literature, including magazines, Colorado Mountain Club newsletters, and plant-identifying books, among other print materials. This digital exhibit explores and highlights her personal photo album from a 1914 mountaineering trip with the Colorado Mountain Club to what would become Rocky Mountain National Park the following year. The album documents the trip with film photographs and typewritten journal pages describing Pearl's persepctive, experiences, and the Park months before it was recognized as a national site.
